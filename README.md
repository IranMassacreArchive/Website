# 🕊️ Iran Massacre Archive

A decentralized, community-driven digital vault dedicated to preserving the history of the Iran Massacre. Our mission is to document every name, video, and image to ensure the truth is never erased.

## 🛡️ Our Goals
- **Preservation:** Securely store video and photographic evidence.
- **Verification:** Establish a community-led "vouching" system to protect against AI-generated fakes and misinformation.
- **Transparency:** Create a searchable database of victims verified by eyewitnesses and family members.

## 💻 Tech Volunteers Needed
We are currently in the **foundation phase**. We need skilled developers to help build:
- A secure **User Portal** for evidence submission.
- A **Moderation Dashboard** for content verification.
- **Resilient Hosting** to protect against censorship.

**Current Tech Stack:** HTML/CSS (Moving toward Next.js + Supabase)

## 🤝 How to Help

2. **Contributors:** We are developing a secure way to submit evidence. For now, please stay tuned.
